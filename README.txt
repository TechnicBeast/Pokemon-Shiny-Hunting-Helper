*The "USUM Shiny Hunting Helper.exe" is an already exported project.
	- Keep all of the files together, as all of them are required to run the Shiny Hunting Helper.

	This is a simple Shiny Hunting Helper. It allows you to keep track of encounters and the currently hunted Pokemon, and the last Pokemon caught.
Future updates and featres are planned, but no promises on additional content is guarenteed. This currently has only been tested on Windows.

*It is NOT a bot that will automatically shiny hunt for you. It simply helps you keep track of your shiny hunting adventure.

To Use:
	1. Run the .exe file.
	2. The Helper should be easy to use as all the buttons and keybinds are simple and most are explained by pressing the "About" button.
	3. On Windows, the save file should be located within the User file folder. This can be deleted if you want to reset progress.

	This is my first real project on Godot. I don't know much about coding or optimization, but I wanted to create something, so loading might be slower than most 
other projects. I am really thinking about adding more features, such as an infinately long list of the shiny Pokemon you've already got. I think I've set up this project 
to allow me to add onto it in the future without making major changes. For me to add any updates, however, I would need to learn more about coding in Godot.
